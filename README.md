This repository is for simulation and testing of machine learning methods of a basic racing game. It features a tkinter app for creating and driving on custom tracks.
The machine learning task of interest is generating control inputs for taking optimal turns. It utilizes a novel synthetic data generation technique (for this task) which will be explained after some tests are run.
